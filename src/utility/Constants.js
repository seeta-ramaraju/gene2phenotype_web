It is made up of machine classifiers trained to predict whether human protein coding genes are likely to be associated with dominant-negative, gain-of-function, or loss-of-function molecular disease mechanisms In many cases, the different dominant molecular mechanisms are not mutually exclusive in a gene.",

Gain-of-function mechanisms are characterized by an altered or newly appeared function in the mutant protein. Genes with higher scores are more likely to be associated with a gain of function disease mechanism. The recommended threshold for pGOF is 0.61.",

    "Badonyi and Marsh pLOF: the probability that the protein is associated with a loss-of-function disease mechanism (pLOF). A loss-of-function mechanism is characterised by complete ablation of the function of the proteinGenes with higher scores are more likely to be associated with a loss of function disease mechanism. The recommended threshold for pLOF is 0.64.",

    "Badonyi and Marsh pDN: the probability that the protein is associated with a dominant-negative disease mechanism (pDN). Dominant-negative mechanisms are characterized by the mutant protein directly or indirectly disrupting the function of the wild type protein.
